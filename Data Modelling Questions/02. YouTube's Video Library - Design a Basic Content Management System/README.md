You're joining YouTube as a junior data engineer. The team needs a simplified data model to manage videos, channels, and basic viewer interactions.

## Your task is to design a data model that:
- Stores videos with their basic metadata (title, description, upload date, duration)
- Manages channel information and the relationship between channels and videos
- Tracks simple viewer interactions (views, likes, comments)
- Supports basic categories and tags for videos
- Enables simple search functionality by title, channel, and category

## Key questions to address:
- What tables would you create and how would they relate to each other?
- How would you model the relationship between users, channels, and videos?
- What indexes would you create to optimize the most common queries?
- How would you track video view counts efficiently?
- How would you design the comment system?

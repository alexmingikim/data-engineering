# Azure End-to-End Data Engineering Project

This project demonstrates a complete end-to-end data engineering pipeline on Microsoft Azure. It processes the Adventure Works dataset through ingestion, transformation, and serving stages. The pipeline implements the Medallion Architecture (Bronze: raw data, Silver: cleaned/transformed data, Gold: aggregated/serving-ready data) to ensure organised data flow. It covers dynamic ETL pipelines, big data transformations with Spark, secure API integrations, and BI visualisations.

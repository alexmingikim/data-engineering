# Data Engineering Projects 🚀

This repository contains a collection of data engineering projects that demonstrate practical applications of data pipelines, database management, ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) workflows, and big data tools. The projects are designed to showcase skills in building scalable, efficient, and reliable systems for handling data end-to-end.

## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools

Across the projects in this repo, you’ll find implementations using:
- Programming Languages: Python, SQL
- Databases: PostgreSQL, SQL Server, PostgreSQL
- Data Processing: Pandas, (PySpark)
- Workflow Orchestration: Airflow
- Data Warehousing: Snowflake
- Containers & Deployment: Docker
- Cloud Platforms: AWS

*(Not every project uses all tools; see project-specific READMEs for details*.)

## 📊 List of Projects
- Automated Weather Data ETL Pipeline using Airflow and AWS S3 - This project implements a simple ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) data pipeline using Apache Airflow to fetch real-time weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API, transform it into a structured format using Pandas, and load it into an AWS S3 bucket for storage.

- Stock Ticker Ingestion Pipeline – This project automates the extraction and loading of stock ticker data from the Polygon.io API into a Snowflake data warehouse.

# Data Engineering Projects 🚀

This repository contains a collection of data engineering projects that demonstrate practical applications of data pipelines, database management, ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) workflows, and big data tools. The projects are designed to showcase skills in building scalable, efficient, and reliable systems for handling data end-to-end.

## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools

Across the projects in this repo, you’ll find implementations using:
- Programming Languages: Python, SQL
- Databases: PostgreSQL, SQL Server, PostgreSQL
- Data Processing: Pandas, PySpark
- Workflow Orchestration: Airflow, Prefect
- Data Warehousing: Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift
- Containers & Deployment: Docker, Kubernetes
- Cloud Platforms: AWS, Azure

*(Not every project uses all tools; see project-specific READMEs for details*.)

## 📊 Example Projects

# ETL Pipeline with Python
This project demonstrates a complete ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) workflow using Python.
The pipeline extracts data from SQL Server's AdventureWorks database, applies basic transformations, and loads the processed data into a PostgreSQL database.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

The goal is to provide a hands-on example of moving data between heterogeneous database systems using Python.
We connect to SQL Server to pull sample business data, transform it to match the target schema, and then load it into PostgreSQL for further reporting.

### Key features:

- Extract data from SQL Server (AdventureWorks sample database)

- Transform data using Python (e.g., column selection, renaming, type conversion)

- Load processed data into PostgreSQL

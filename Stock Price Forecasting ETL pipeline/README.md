# Stock Price ETL Pipeline

## Overview

This project implements an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline for stock price data. The pipeline extracts historical stock price information from the Yahoo Finance API, transforms the data into a clean and structured format, and prepares it for downstream use, such as uploading to TimeGPT's API for stock price forecasting.

The goal of this pipeline is to automate the data preparation process for financial forecasting and analysis.
